# Antikythera hole analysis
This repository attempts to replicate the analysis completed in [1]. 

I'll start by defining an oracle with a known number of calendar ring holes and then derive a technique to back out the number of holes in the oracle. Then apply that to the data from the antikythera mechanism.
